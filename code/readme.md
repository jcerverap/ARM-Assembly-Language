These examples follow the course ARM Assembly Language From Ground Up™ 1 from UDEMY (https://www.udemy.com/course/arm-assembly-programming/).
CORTEX Assemble code is used instead of the Thump language followed in the course (personal preference)
The code has been tested using the free online emulator named cpulator (https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc)
